# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of the project, is to understand the website visitor buying behaviour, 
and trying to find a pattern between location, time spent on site, time of the year, products, product category and total revenue generated.

## Process
1- Extracted the data from CVS files
2- Cleaned the data, deal with NULL values, drop unwanted columns, convert some columns data type
3- Created new tabels, assign primary and foreing keys
4- Used JOIN to collect data from different tables.
5- USED Tableau for visualization.

## Results
- USA has the biggest market by far, 92% of the revenues generated from USA.
- No clear pattern between time spent on site by the visitor and revenues.
- Overall, the revenues generated from North American and Europe  

## Challenges 
- No clear description of the data provided, not clear how total revenues are calculated.
- City and country information is not 100% accurate, like Paris in USA.
- Alot missing values in city column.
- No connection/relatioships between the tables. 

## Future Goals
I would look at the impact of product stocking and total revenues, do we need to improve the restocking lead time?
